README file for the SimFold package, to compute the MFE
energy and secondary structure of folding, according to
Zuker and Stiegler's dynamic programming algorithm (1981).

Implemented by Mirela Andronescu (andrones@cs.ubc.ca).

Makefile  - type make to compile exsimfold.cpp

exsimfold - The program compiled on Linux 2.4.20-30.9smp,
using g++, version  3.2.2.	

exsimfold.cpp 	- the C++ program that uses the simfold 
function. Use this program as an example.
The main steps are:
- include the simfold library
#include "simfold.h"
- initialize the thermodynamic parameters
init_data (config_file, dna_or_rna, temperature);
where config_file is "params/pairfold.conf", dna_or_rna is
RNA, and temperature is between 0 and 100, usually 37.
- call the simfold function:
energy = simfold (sequence, structure);
This returns the predicted minimum free energy for the given
sequence. structure is the predicted mfe structure. The 
structure must have enough space allocated (at least 
length(sequence)+1).
Currently, only constraints for "base must not be paired" 
can be set. This can be done by setting "x" to the structure
in the appropriate positions.

libsimfold.a  	- the simfold library, compiled on Linux 
2.4.20-30.9smp, using g++, version  3.2.2.   

params/  	- a directory with the thermodynamic 
parameters for RNA.

simfold.h	- a header file, with the function prototypes 
for RNA folding.
